#Project Title
COride - an easier way to get where you want to go. 

##Description
COride is a forum where drivers can make some extra money by offering to share their car with COriders that are planning to go in the same direction as their driver. We verify all of our drivers, and COriders to make sure it is a safe, pleasant experience for all parties involved. When Uber, Lyft, or a plane ticket cost too much to get you to your destination, use COride to get to where you want to go; cheaper.
